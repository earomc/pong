# Pong
A simple version of Pong written in Rust
My first game written in a non-block programming language! :D

# Running the game
Simple: Download the .zip file, unpack it and run the pong.exe :)
Little warning! The sounds can get a bit loud in the beginning if you have your system sounds on max. 

# Controls
Best is to have a friend who can control the second paddle. But it can be fun playing alone too :')

### Player 1: 
W = Up
A = Down

### Player 2:
Arrow Up = Up
Arrow Down = Down
